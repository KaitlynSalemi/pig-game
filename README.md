This is a two-player die rolling game built with Javascript.

1. Roll the die to increase your current score
2. If you roll a 1, your current score goes back down to 0 and it's the next person's turn
3. Hold your turn to add your current score to your over all score
4. The first person to get their overall score to 100 wins the game
5. Reset the game at anytime
